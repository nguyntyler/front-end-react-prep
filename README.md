## Promises

Promises are objects. They have a .then function. What gets passed in them are callbacks.

> Callbacks are arguments that is a function. Does not have to be an arrow function. Sometimes has to be an anonymous function.

Pomises can chain the returning data from either the initial call from the API or the previous .then callbacks that returns data.

> Closure is when an inner function accesses the outer function's variables.

Closures happen a lot in promises when working with data.
