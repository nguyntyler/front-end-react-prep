# Touches on the following concepts.

    -   Callbacks
    -   Closures
    -   addEventListener
    -   Spread operator
        -   For objects and arrays
    -   Destructuring syntax
    -   `&&` and `||`

# Intros:

    -   Promises
    -   Prototypes
    -   Classes

## Promises

Promises are objects. They have a .then function. What gets passed in them are callbacks.

> Callbacks are arguments that is a function. Does not have to be an arrow function. Sometimes has to be an anonymous function.

Promises organize asynchonus code.

Pomises can chain the returning data from either the initial call from the API or the previous .then callbacks that returns data.

Promised exist in one of three states:

    - Pending
    - Fulfilled
    - Rejected

> Closure is when an inner function accesses the outer function's variables.

Closures happen a lot in promises when working with data.
Closures and callbacks are the same thing. Closures are also anonymous functions that just uses variables from outside of the function.

> Higher-order functions accept or returns a function.

---

Promises are both .then (able) and async await (able).
